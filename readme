## iLoveWater

#### An application which knows how much water you need to drink every day and will always remind you when you forget.

You know how they say you should drink a couple of litres of water per day? Most of us genuinely want to adhere to this and often try to get into the habit but we can never keep it up for more than three days!

Why? ‘Cause we’re busy.

But being busy shouldn’t mean that you stay dehydrated.

iLoveWater is an App that knows how much you need to drink daily, how much you have had so far and reminds you when you forget. (OS X support)
